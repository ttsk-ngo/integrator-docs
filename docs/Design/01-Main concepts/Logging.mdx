# Logging
Application logs following data:
- Time of log entry
- Logging level
- correlation id
- client IP
- Namespace from where the log was made (context)
- Log message
- Exception message\*

\*Only in case of exception logging 

## Core logger
Core logger logs everything with a logging level equal to or higher than the one set in `appsettings.json`. Core logger logs are stored in `/Integrator.Api/Logs/Core`. Core logger does not log exception messages, which means that only the occurrence of an exception is logged, and the exception logger should be viewed for details.

## Exception logger
The Exception logger only logs messages with a logging level equal to or higher than “error”, but it also logs exception messages. Exception logger logs are stored in `/Integrator.Api/Logs/Exception`.
