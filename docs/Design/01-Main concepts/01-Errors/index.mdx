# Errors
Errors are returned by throwing `IntegratorException` specifically built for this use. Thrown exception is then caught in exception middleware which detects its type (handled or unhandled) and returns appropriate HTTP response with its body.

## Error response
```json
{
    "statusCode": "string",
    "reason": "string",
    "messages": ["string"]
}
```
In addition to HTTP codes, a `x-correlation-id` header has been implemented so that the user can receive a unique identifier for his request, which can be used to report errors to the development team.

## Status codes
Status codes are a way to distinguish exactly what happened during the processing of a request. They are helpful because for ex. HTTP 400 codes are not enough to properly inform the user of what happened.

### Structure
Status codes are 5 digits. The first two digits and the last three are separated by a dash. The first two digits specify the part of the application from which the error was thrown. The remaining digits are the next number from the previous status code.
