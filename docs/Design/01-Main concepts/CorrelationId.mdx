# Correlation ID
The correlation identifier is generated for each request and is used to track the particular request in the application logs. External applications making calls to the Integrator API can find the correlation ID of their request in the `x-correlation-id` header. The correlation ID must be displayed to users every time there is an error that violates functionality, so that the development team can track down the error based on the request's correlation ID.
