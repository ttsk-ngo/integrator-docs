# UR-FR0001 - Access to user records
- Users can only see their own records.
- Users with more powerful roles can only see records of users with less powered roles.

Records are shown to the users only to a limited extent:
- date and time of issue
- length and expiration date
- reason
- penalty points (if implemented)
