# G-FR0001 - Login
Integrator supports OIDC login as the only login option available for ordinary users. Administators are provided with additional login panel for logging into local accounts.

## OIDC login
Integrator acts as OIDC client app consuming *authorization code flow*.

## Syncing user data
After each login, Integrator fetches user's data and syncs it with its own resources. Changes made on the IdP side are treated as a priority. Mapping IdP user claims to Integrator's own data records is possible to set in application's settings file. Integrator identifies its users only by `sub` claim.
