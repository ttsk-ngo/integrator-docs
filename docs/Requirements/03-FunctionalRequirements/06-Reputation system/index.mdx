# Reputation System

The reputation system is a new mechanic designed to partially replace the complaint system and complex and difficult to understand regulations with an automated or semi-automated mechanism for rewarding and penalizing simulator users. The fundamental assumption is to provide a tool that is attractive enough to users to encourage them to interact with the TrainDriver 2 simulator environment in a manner that is maximally consistent with the authors' intentions:
- with respect for other users
- in accordance with railway regulations
- in accordance with the spirit of the simulation

On the other hand, the tool should minimize negative, malicious, or gameplay-spoiling behavior, while at the same time forgiving minor errors and slips.
