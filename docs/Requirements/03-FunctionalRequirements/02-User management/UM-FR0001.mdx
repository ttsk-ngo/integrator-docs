# UM-FR0001 - Pending accounts
During registration process in TTSK's IdP there is a possibility that a user account may not pass automatical approval. Integrator app has an interface for moderation team members to accept or reject pending accounts. Integrator fetches data about the account from IdP and presents it to the moderation team member. Moderation team members are provided with information on how many accounts are pending approval in their user interfaces.

## Integration with user records and bans
Integrator automatically searches user records and bans databases by IP address and presents found information to the moderation team.
