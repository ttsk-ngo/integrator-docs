# UM-FR0003 - Moderation mode of user profile

Regular users do not have access to the moderation mode. Moderation mode allows moderators to view and manage user's sessions, bans, penalty points, warnings, etc..

Moderation mode should be displayed as a modified user profile page, but moderation features should be clearly separated from default user profile view.
