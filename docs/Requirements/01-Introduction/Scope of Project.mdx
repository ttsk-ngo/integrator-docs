# Scope of project

## Integrator 2.0 project

The idea for the Integrator application was born from the need to bring together multiple applications, often written in different languages and technologies, into a single, easily accessible whole. An additional, technical reason for the creation of this application is to simplify the flow of data between different tools, which enables better integration and extends the functionality of previously used tools.
Integrator from perspective of an user is an application consisting of modules. Each module corresponds to a certain user-oriented group of functionality, but such a division is not reflected in the API, which is designed to support any number of modules.

## Suggested modules

**CORE** - basic templates, features and tools  
**ME** - data acquisition and statistics presentation  
**NGO** - replacing currently (as of 2024) used Integrator 1.0 app for collecting dontations to TTSK association  
**SZS** - scenery management - helps builders in management and release of sceneries. Reliable source of data about sceneries for all users.  
**ZWB** - scenery design support  
**S1** - generation of train timetables  
**ZEW1** - set of tools and procedures for train drivers (WOS, selected regulations, ground rules, etc.)  
**ZEW3** - set of tools and procedures for train dispatchers (written orders, R-162 books, usable lengths, selected regulations, etc.)  
**ZEW10** - statuses of all TTSK services  
**LIVE** - traffic organisation and visualisation  
**SOS** - help with day-to-day operation of the simulator  
**BAN** - a tool that will replace the current complaint system  
**PRIV** - private sesions management  
**GO** - reservation of sceneries and trains  
**CALC** - essential calculators needed for scenery building  
**OPTR** - a tool that will introduce virtual freight and passenger carriers which will be possible to create by the users

Please note that above list is only a proposal. Some of the modules may never be created or will be created in other applications (ex. SWDR 5 project)
